# cameraApp
A cross-platform Flutter UI, with virtual lens simulation on any device. Phones have fixed lenses/sensors. Youâ€™ll simulate focal lengths by choosing the closest physical camera (ultrawide/wide/tele), then cropping to match a target FOV. Depth-of-field and aperture are simulated (subject-aware blur), not physical.
